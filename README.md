The client is Gaming Room, they are a gaming industry service. Their wishes were to have a cloud-based server for their users to use. Gaming Room was servicing their client base with a server to host games online and for potential streaming. 
My documentation had detailed systems requirements for their needs. What type of systens and the likelihood of what would be required for their use 
The document aided me in my thinking process to the best of my knowledge to code. It gave a guideline for how best to start the coding. Since some systems do better with some languages than others it allows for a narrowing of possibilities, Early insights can kept production time down and more focused.
The first part of my project needs more refinement. I did not give it the time and respect it deserved
As a gamer myself I understand some of the wishes of Game Room’s clientele. Clear connections, plenty of options, ability to stream. Users’ needs are always important to think about in the building of a project. If the client is not happy with the work then the job is not done. 
Future software will have a better understanding of the process going forward. Starting off with an idea of the client and their needs. While I understand this client it does not mean I’ll understand the next as well. For a similar build, I would suggest similar work to what was done here adding to that more possible options I might be able to improve on since
